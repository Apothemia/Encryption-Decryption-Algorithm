Dads are good at so many things, from teaching you how to ride a bike to showing you how to change a tire,
and everything in between. They provide a reassuring hand to hold and a strong shoulder to cry on all with
that special sense of humor known as dad jokes. What's a dad joke, you ask? It's that groan-worthy, pun-laden,
can't-help-but-laugh type of humor that dads are best at delivering. Sure, there are mom jokes and jokes for kids,
but we just can't help but laugh at the one-liners from dear old dad.
